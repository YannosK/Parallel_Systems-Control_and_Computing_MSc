# Results directory

This directory is where the results of the [`results.py`](../scripts/results.py) are stored in the form of `.csv` files with proper naming that specifies their contents. They will be generated and stored automatically in directories with names 'sequential/' and 'parallel/'.

The [final_results](./final_results/) directory contains the results that where included in the report. The results saved in this directory are used by the script [`table_creator.py`](../scripts/table_creator.py) to create the tables of the final report.

The [latex_tables](./latex_tables/) directory stores the contents of the tables of the final results, generated by the [`table_creator.py`](../scripts/table_creator.py) script. Inside it, the [templates](./latex_tables/templates/) directory contains the basic scaffold template of the final tables included in the report.

The [saved_results](./saved_results/) direcotry contains some saved results from previous runs.
