# Things for report
- [ ] GPU information (use a script)
- [ ] which times from what script? (ours? theirs?)
- [ ] include reports and which reports?
- [ ] pictures
   - [ ] from the Nsight Systems profiler?
   - [ ] from the output of the `run_assessment()` python script?


# Intentionally left out of the report
- description of how loop unrolling works, with the indexing, the strides etc.
- desctiption of _what is_ the execution configuration and how it works. I used it assuming they know what I am talking about.
- no mention of previous execution configurations (could be added in the discussions, or not at all).
- no precise description of how to get device specific informations.
- no mention of the used GPU compute capablity.
- no serious or detailed mention of what we did with the Nisght Systems (if we did something)
- in general no thorough discussion of an _iterative method_ (this was a thing of the course I think, Karakostas did not ask for it)
